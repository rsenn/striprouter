// Genetic algorithms work in the world of organisms, genes and populations, and
// are built around a batch process, where the fitness is first determined for
// all organisms in the current population and the result is used to create the
// next generation.
//
// In contrast, the rest of this app works in the world of circuits, routes and
// connections. The app just wants to receive an infinite series of (hopefully)
// gradually improving route orderings to be checked for a circuit.
//
// This class, GeneticAlgorithm, wraps the actual GA stuff and translates
// between the two worlds by providing a black box from which an infinite series
// of orderings can be retrieved. The result is returned as a simple vector of
// connection indexes.
//
// As all operations on the underlying GA objects are performed through this
// class, the locking required by this class protects the rest of the GA system.
//
// The app uses multiple threads to check multiple orderings at the same time.
// At the same time, each thread needs to be able to pass back the cost for the
// layout that resulted from the ordering it received since it becomes the
// fitness for the corresponding organism. To support this, the class works as
// follows:
//
// - The client creates a single global instance of GeneticAlgorithm.
// - The client calls reset() whenever the layout changes, which sets up an
// initial population with randomized genes.
// - TODO: When the layout changes, maybe it's better to just keep going on the
// existing population.
// - The object keeps track of how many organisms there are in the
// population and how many organisms have received fitness scores.
// - The object has a single lock and before a thread interacts with the
// object, it must obtain the lock.
// - A thread first retrieves the index of an ordering by calling
// reserveOrdering().
// - The thread then retrieves the actual ordering by calling getOrdering(),
// passing the index.
// - The thread routes the ordering.
// - The thread releases the ordering and provides the cost of the
// resulting layout by calling releaseOrdering(), passing the index and the
// cost.
// - When a fitness score has been received for each organism in the population,
// the creation of a new generation in triggered by the next call to
// reserveOrdering(). The index for the first ordering in the new generation
// (index 0) is then returned.
// - Towards the end of a generation, there may be no more orderings available
// for the generation, at the same time as a new generation cannot be created
// yet because other threads are still working on their orderings and have not
// submitted fitness scores for them. Since threads must obtain the lock both to
// reserve orderings and submit fitness scores, reserveOrdering() cannot simply
// hold the lock and wait until the remaining fitness scores have been received.
// In this situation, reserveOrdering() returns the invalid index of -1, at
// which point the caller must release the lock and wait a bit before trying
// again.
